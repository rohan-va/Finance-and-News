# Financial Webscraping and Model Predicting
This repository is dedicated for a python webscraper. This will consist files related to a scraper that will scrape data online from certain urls (Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, etc.) including stocks, close/open values, volume, etc. and predict them using a RandomForestClassifier model, displaying the predictions in a plot-based image.

More to come...ðŸ‘€
